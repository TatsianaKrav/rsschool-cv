## **About myself**  

My way into the IT sphere began with the “Gender equality of women in IT” program from the IBM Institute of Minsk. I took the course of basic programming in Java, but after a while I realized that it’s Frontend development that appeals to me. I enjoy seeing the result of my work immedialtely, moreover there is some creative part - working with design layouts. I took a one year course of Frontend development in ITlogia school. And now I’m trying to improve my skills. I have intention and a big desire to grow professionally in this sphere.  

## **Skills**  

* HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
* JavaScript, TypeScript  
* SASS, LESS, Gulp, Grunt, Webpack  
* Git, Github  
* Angular  
* Backend, async/await requests  

## **Code Example**  

Task from Codewars: *Define String.prototype.toAlternatingCase (or a similar function/method such as to_alternating_case/toAlternatingCase/ToAlternatingCase in your selected language; see the initial solution for details) such that each lowercase letter becomes uppercase and each uppercase letter becomes lowercase.*  

```
String.prototype.toAlternatingCase = function () {
 
  let arr = this.split('');
  let string = '';
 
  arr.forEach(item => {
    let symbol = item;
    item.toUpperCase() === symbol ? string += item.toLowerCase() : string += item.toUpperCase();
  })
   return string;
}   

```
